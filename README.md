# D-S-A
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages.

Introduction
This repository serves as a resource for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. It includes both classic and advanced implementations, along with explanations and examples.

Contents
The repository is organized into folders for each data structure or algorithm. Here's an overview of the contents:

Data Structures

* Stack: Implementation of a stack data structure.
* Queue: Implementation of a queue data structure.
* BinaryTree: Implementation of a binary tree data structure.
* Graph: Implementation of a graph data structure.
* Heap: Implementation of a binary heap data structure.
  
Algorithms

* Sorting: Implementation of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
* Searching: Implementation of various searching algorithms including linear search, binary search, etc.
* DynamicProgramming: Implementation of dynamic programming algorithms.
